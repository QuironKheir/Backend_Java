# Object-Oriented-Programming-Course
The mission: to make virtuality identical to reality:
* Know the different object-oriented programming languages.
* Analyze problems for object-oriented project development.
* Understand how objects work.
* Understand how classes work.


___
## Objects
Objects help us to create an instance of a class, the object is the result of what we model, of the declared parameters and we will use the objects to make our classes come alive.


```
### Java
Person person = new Person();

### Python
person = Person();

### JavaScript
var person = new Person();

### PHP
$person = new Person();
```

## Constructor Method
The constructor methods give an initial state to the object and we can add some data to the object using these methods. The attributes or elements that we pass through the constructor will be the minimum data that the object needs so that it can live.
